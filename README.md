# Generated-datasets-for-burst-detection

This repository contains the dataset for the four generated cases used in Zanfei et al., (2022).
Specifically:
- WDts(number)_dataset contains the datasets adopted in the study;
- WDts(number)_only_flows contains only the flow rates of the pipes that provides water to the network (their sum is the total demand of the network);
- WDts(number)_pressures contains the pressure values for each node of the network.

For further details and requests contact directly the authors. If you use plan to use the data refer to the below citation.
